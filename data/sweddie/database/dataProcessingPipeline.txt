This document provides an overview of the SWEDDIE data processing pipeline. This is an evolving document.

Steps:
1. Data sent from provider
  - data file guidelines:
    - measurement data (active heating time series, temperature, moisture, CO2 fluxes, etc.) are linked to core tables via the 'exp_name', 'sit_name', and 'plt_name' variables
    - all data must be able to be associated with one of the plot IDs (column 'plt_name') given in the "plot" table
    - depth data must be provided in the data file itself or in the data dictionary file (see below)
    - horizontal data orientation is preferred
  2) for multiple entries within a single cell, please separate with ";" (semicolon) and no spaces
  3) Missing data values preferably "NA". Please specify missing data values, not a number values (e.g., "NAN"), etc., in the file level metadata questionnaire

2. Check that each data file is accompanied by:
  a) metadata file
    - can be generated via the "SWEDDIE Data Submission" google form
    - can be provided by filling out a template
    - follow the ESS-DIVE "file level metadata" standard

  b) data dictionary file
    - formerly known as an "annotation file"
    - data dictionary (dd) files are based on the "CSV_dd" guidelines from ESS-DIVE, which contain the following columns:
      - Column_or_Row_Name
      - Unit
      - Definition
      - Column_or_Row_Long_Name
      - Data_Type
    - SWEDDIE dd files follow slightly different naming conventions and contain additional columns to capture sensor and method information:
      - colName
      - colNameExt
      - description
      - unit
      - dataType
      - sensorMakeModel
      - methodName
      - methodNotes
      - methodDOI
      - depthTop
      - depthBottom
