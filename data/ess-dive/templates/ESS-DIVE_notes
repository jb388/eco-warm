Notes on ESS-DIVE formats/workflow

Useful components to adapt:
1. CSV standards
  - gives guidance for file structure, naming structure, and field structure of data files
    - in SWEDDIE, all .csv files must be paired with a '_dd.csv' file (see below)
    - ESS-DIVE allows alternative formating of .csv files in which, e.g., the second row contains units or descriptions, but with SWEDDIE we will store this information in a separate file
  - akin to my plan, .csv files are accompanied by a data dictionary file (CSV_dd.csv), which provides metadata for parsing (this is essentially the same as the annotation file)
    - the '_dd' files would replace the 'xxxMeta' files
  - CSV_dd column names (see 'csv_detailed_guide.md' for more info):
    - Column_or_Row_Name
    - Unit
    - Definition
    - Column_or_Row_Long_Name
    - Data_Type

2. File level metadata
  - FLMD provides the necessary metadata to ingest a dataset into ESS-dive
    - these files pertain to the 'dat' files, i.e., all 'dat' files will be paired with an accompanying 'flmd' file
  - the FLMD format covers most (all?) of the metadata characteristics needed for SWEDDIE as well
    - note that this information is not currently captured in SWEDDIE
  - FLMD files can be parsed with off-the-shelf code that converts the data into JSON-LD format, which in turn is converted into preferred ESS-DIVE file types (e.g., EML)
  - the conversion process uses the ESS-DIVE dataset REST API
    - in R, required packages are httr, jsonlite, readr
  - column names (see 'flmd_quick_guide.md' for more info):
      - File_Name
      - File_Description
      - Standard
      - UTC_Offset
      - File_Version
      - Contact
      - Date_Start
      - Date_End
      - Northwest_Latitude_Coordinate
      - Northwest_Longitude_Coordinate
      - Southeast_Latitude_Coordinate
      - Southeast_Longitude_Coordinate
      - Latitude
      - Longitude
      - Missing_Value_Codes
      - Data_Orientation
      - Notes


  Adapted to SWEDDIE:
  - each data file will be accompanied by a data dictionary file (dat_dd.csv)
  - the data dictionary file only exists to
