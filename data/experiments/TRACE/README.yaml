Physiological acclimation was assessed on two understory shrubs, Psychotria brachiata and Piper glabrescens, through photosynthetic and respiratory temperature response curves measured at four time points; January 2016, August 2016, January-February 2017, and June 2017. Supplemental physiology data were collected throughout the study period, including stomatal morphology and measures of the photosynthetic biochemical responses to temperature. Complementary environmental data were collected by TRACE describing surface temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, and soil moisture within the experimental plots. Environmental conditions underneath the canopy and rainfall were also collected and used for the study. The dataset includes approximately two years of environmental measurements of the field site and 1.5 years of physiology measurements. Also included are data analyses R code used in Carter et al. (2020)."
