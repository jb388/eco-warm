    "Hi Jeff,

    It was not there because we just have one measurement per ploy and not several as for depth temperatures. Also that data is recorded at a different frequency (hourly) than temperatures. I am working on that but I have some problems with some gaps on the data. I am trying to fill it recovering data from old folders and backup folders. First years there were issues with the data collection and there are hundreds of small files. I will send it to you soon

    Thanks, Rai"
