    - re soil moisture (19 Nov. 2024), "Hi Jeff, It was not there because we just have one measurement per ploy and not several as for depth temperatures. Also that data is recorded at a different frequency (hourly) than temperatures. I am working on that but I have some problems with some gaps on the data. I am trying to fill it recovering data from old folders and backup folders. First years there were issues with the data collection and there are hundreds of small files. I will send it to you soon. Thanks, Rai"
