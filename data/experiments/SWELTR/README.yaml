  - notes on CO2 flux data:
      "There are the first 2 years of data, which should be a good start for this first exercise. We have more data beyond this (from 2022-2025), but it’s still being processed
      if more data becomes available I’ll follow up with further data to include.
      The warming was switched on 1 November 2016, so the data here begin shortly following.
      Note that we don’t have time stamps for these data - we only recorded the date of measurement, because all data were collected during a short-window around midday when we have field site access (9pm-3pm) and there is little-to-no diurnal variation in soil temperature (certainly no effect of time of day during this time period). Therefore if time stamp necessary you could include a midday time-stamp for all (12noon +-3 hours).
      We are exploring measuring diurnal CO2 emissions using automatic chambers - but this is work in progress. If you want to explore diurnal patterns in CO2 emissions, I can follow up with those data as become available.
      Note that here there is data ’type’ =COLLAR. Which means a regular soil collar (surface soil CO2 efflux).
      In the master file I also have partitioned fluxes (using root exclusion cores) with headings SOIL/ROOTS. We calculated the root component by using the ratio of these to calculate the % from roots vs soil (which we assume removed any bias from the core treatment affecting the flux rate), then applying that % to the regular (collar) flux rate.  The data were quite noisy  from these partitioning cores - we’ve since set up a new/less invasive method to measure this which reduces measurement noise. To keep things simple for now I just include the surface CO2 fluxes - but if you want other data I can send through too."
