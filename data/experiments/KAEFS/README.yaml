Contents:
  - soil temperature data from KAEFS site
Notes:
  - data provided by Z. Shi in July '24
  - still missing moisture data as of 28 Sep. '24
  - formatting is a challenge for data entry
    - data entered vertically, but identifying information is provided above the data cells
    - created a derived version of the data with identifying information condensed into a "_" separated string
    - used this to output a horizontally oriented data file ("temperature_200908_201802_daily_reshaped.csv")
  - data dictionary information originally provided as "Numbers" file
    - data from this file extracted and entered into dd file
  - flmd file also created by J. Beem-Miller
  - additional data provided by Z. Shi in Oct. '24
    - soil moisture, ANPP, BNPP, soil properties, local climate
  - BNPP provided as Numbers file, which I downloaded as a .csv into the derived directory
    - first row of numbers file specifies that depth increment is 0-90 cm
    - this information is now in the accompanying _dd file
